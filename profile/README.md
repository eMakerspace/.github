# eMakerspace@OST
- Do you like doing things with electronics?
- Do you want to do it together?
- Do you need some equipment?
- Do you study [electrical engineering @ OST](https://www.ost.ch/de/studium/technik/bachelor-electrical-and-computer-engineering)?

**We have you covered!**

We are a group of seven electrical engineering students. Together we enjoy electronics and work hard on our own projects in our spare time.
However, we feel that these projects should not be done in the privacy of our own homes. It's more fun together and the learning effect is greater for everyone.

That's why we started an eMakerspace@OST in Rapperswil.
Our goal is to provide a room with the necessary equipment for all students of the electrical engineering department.
